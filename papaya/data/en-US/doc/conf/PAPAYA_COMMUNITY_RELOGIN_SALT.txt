When the surfer logs in automatically, the hash key is created from a token and saved in the cookie of the surfer. The token is a random value (GUID). The value of the salt option can be optionally added to the token before computing the hash value in order to increase the information content of the input. In addition, you should use a salt value which preferably contains mostly non alphanumeric values. The salt value will increase the safety of the hash keys.
