In case it is not possible for a backend user to save the sesison id in a cookie, you can choose one of the following fallback methods:<ul><li><em>None</em>: papaya CMS will not try to assign a session id to the website visitor by applying an alternative method.<br /></li><li><em>Path Rewrite</em>: The session id is inserted into the URL using URL rewriting.<br /></li><li><em>Transparent SID</em>: The session id is written into the URL by PHP before the page is put out. Please note that this complicates page caching.<br /></li></ul>
