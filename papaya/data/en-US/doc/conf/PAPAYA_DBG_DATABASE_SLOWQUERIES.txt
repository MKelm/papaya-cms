Time threshold in milliseconds for sql queries. This option is deactivated if you enter "0". In case a database query takes longer than the time given, the query will be executed again with the EXPLAIN command. This allows to analyze slow sql queries which may cause timeout errors in the PHP program or just slow down the page delivery. Using this option, the warning message for each slow query will be issued as a debug message. When you want to log slow queries, you can use the option <tt>PAPAYA_DBG_LOG_SLOWQUERIES</tt>. Both options can be used independently.
