Divisor that will be used to calculate the probability that old log entries will be deleted. The divisor can have a value between 1 and 999. When the value is 1, the probability is 1/1, when the value is 999, it is 1/999. With this entry, you can determine the rate at which old log entries will be deleted from the database. A high divisor value prevents calling the deletion process each time a user logs in.
