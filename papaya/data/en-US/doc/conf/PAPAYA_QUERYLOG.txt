This option controls which database SELECT queries are logged in the query log table with their corresponding EXPLAINs:
<ul>
<li><em>none</em>: No queries are logged.</li>
<li><em>slow</em>: Only slow queries are logged (the threshold is defined by the <tt>PAPAYA_QUERYLOG_SLOW</tt> option).</li>
<li><em>all</em>: All queries are logged.</li>
</ul>
Make sure to always choose <em>none</em> in a production environment, as the system will be slowed sown notably by the database analysis procedures.
