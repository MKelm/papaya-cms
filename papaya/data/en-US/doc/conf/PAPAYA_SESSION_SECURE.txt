"On" to start sessions for frontend and backend only if HTTPS is active, otherwise "Off". When you activate this option, session cookies will be bound to a HTTPS connection. This means that session cookies will only be valid for HTTPS and the session id will never be sent over an HTTP connection. Further, you can activate this option only if you are already logged in via HTTPS into the backend. In addition, you can enforce usage of HTTPS only for the backend, see option <tt>PAPAYA_UI_SECURE</tt>.
