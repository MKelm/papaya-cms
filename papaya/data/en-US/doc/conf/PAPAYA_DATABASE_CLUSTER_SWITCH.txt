When using RDBMS clusters with master and slave servers, you can redirect reading operations from the slave servers to the master server after papaya CMS has written data to the master database. This is done in order to circumvent temporary data inkonsistencies between the master and the slave database servers:<ul><li><em>manual</em>: Redirection of read access to the master server has to be activated explicitly in the source code, otherwise it does not apply.<br /></li><li><em>object</em>: Redirection of read access to the master server is performed only for the object that has written data to the database.<br /></li><li><em>connection</em>: Redirection of read access to the master server is performed for the whole connection after a write operation. Redirection can then affect multiple objects.<br /></li></ul>
