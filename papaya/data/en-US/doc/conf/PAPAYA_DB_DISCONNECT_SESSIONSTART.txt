"On" to close the database connection when starting a session, otherwise "Off". The database connection is closed only when the option <tt>PAPAYA_DB_CONNECT_PERSISTENT</tt> in the conf.inc.php is set to "FALSE". This option will increase the performance of website that have many dynamic requests. Opening a session can cost a lot of time, since a session is only allowed to open one request. The session will therefore be left blocked for other requests. All the other requests that demand access to the session data won't have a chance to be answered. In order to prevent the database connection to be open for this request, you can close it with this option. This allows papaya CMS to use the database connection for other requests.
