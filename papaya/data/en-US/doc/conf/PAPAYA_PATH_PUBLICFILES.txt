Path in DocumentRoot which leads to a directory containing softlinks to thumbnails. A softlink is created automatically on a thumbnail request for a thumbnail in the MediaDB. The softlink is then saved in this directory. On the next request for this thumbnail, the webserver delivers the thumbnail image directly without forwarding the request to papaya CMS. Please note the following points:<ul><li>When the given path does not exist or is not accessable to the webserver, this funktion will be deactivated.<br /></li><li>The operating system in use, i.e. the file system, has to support softlinks.<br /></li><li>The softlinks will be used exlusively for public thumbnails which are not protected by access privileges.<br /></li><li>This function uses rewrite rules in the .htaccess file.<br /></li></ul>
